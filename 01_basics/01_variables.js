/* avaScript is a "dynamically typed language", which means that, unlike some other languages, you don't need to specify what data type a variable will contain (numbers, strings, arrays, etc.).

For example, if you declare a variable and give it a value enclosed in quotes, the browser treats the variable as a string:  */

/*
As well as variables, you can declare constants. These are like variables, except that:

you must initialize them when you declare them
you can't assign them a new value after you've initialized them.

//-----------Note---------------- This means that if you can initialize a variable when you declare it, and don't need to reassign it later, make it a constant.
